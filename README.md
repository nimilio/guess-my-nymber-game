# guess-my-nymber-game
Game in browser written in HTML, CSS and JS

This game is originally created in the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" and I have updated it with more features.

In this game, the user must predict a hidden number and the highscore is also maintained throughout the games.

I updated the game by adding three different levels: Easy, Medium and Hard. In these levels, the user must guess the hidden number in different ranges: 1-20, 1-70 and 1-100 correspondingly. Also, in the hard level the score is reduced by 2 points with every mistake, but by 1 point in the rest levels. The highscore is maintained as long as the user is playing games in the same difficulty level, and it returns to 0 if the level is changed. The user receives different messages depending on how close the guess is to the hidden number. In the medium and hard level, the message is more explicit due to the greater number range, such as if the difference between the hidden number and the guess is greater than 20, greater than 10 or less than 10.
